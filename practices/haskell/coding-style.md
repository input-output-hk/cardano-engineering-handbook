# Coding style

Most project teams develop some opinions on how they want to write code.
It can be helpful to write these down, to help with onboarding new people and to provide a place to explain such decisions.

There aren't many examples of public Haskell style guides, but several Cadano teams have written their own:
- [`plutus`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.adoc)
- [Adrestia](https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/code)
- [`hydra`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/wiki/Coding-Standards)
