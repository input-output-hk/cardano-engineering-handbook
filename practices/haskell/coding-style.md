# Coding style

Most project teams develop some opinions on how they want to write code.
It can be helpful to write these down, to help with onboarding new people and to provide a place to explain such decisions.

Here are some style guides written by Cardano teams: 
- [`plutus`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.adoc)
- [Adrestia](https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/code)
- [`hydra`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/wiki/Coding-Standards)
- [Consensus team in `ouroboros-network`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/blob/master/ouroboros-consensus/docs/StyleGuide.md)
- [Network team in `ouroboros-network`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/blob/master/docs/StyleGuide.md)
