# Security

Maintaining the security of the Cardano blockchain is a paramount
concern.  Consistent with other blockchain projects, we will adopt a
policy of responsible notification, responsible development, and responsible disclosure of
security patches.  Given the open nature of Cardano development, this will require particular
care over how security issues are handled by code maintainers.


## Security Issues

Possible security concerns should be notified to: XX

All security concerns will be evaluated.  If a vulnerability is deemed
to exist, then a fix will be developed and released.  All care will be
taken not to expose the nature of the vulnerability, both during
code development and as part of the release.  This may include using a private
fork for the  development of the fix, including the fix as part of another code commit,
taking appropriate care when writing code comments/descriptions, silent fixes, or other techniques.


## Responsible Disclosure


If we silently fix a vulnerability and a hard fork is needed to enable the fix then:

- we will publish the details about the vulnerability 4-8 weeks after the hard fork

If we silently fix a vulnerability and a hard fork is not needed to enable the fix then:

- After 4-8 weeks, we will disclose that the release contained a security-fix;
- After an additional 4-8 weeks, we will publish the details about the vulnerability

- TODO: Need a contributor from our security teams to help write these.
- TODO: Adapt draft audit requirements doc into the handbook.
- TODO: Write a policy on foreign libraries.
- DRAFTED: Write a policy on responsible disclosure.
