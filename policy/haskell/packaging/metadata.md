# Haskell package metadata

Haskell packages have a lot of metadata that can be provided via `.cabal` files.
This policy gives guidance on what to put in the various fields.
See [the cabal documentation](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cabal-package.html#package-properties) for what these fields mean.

| Field                | Policy                                                                                                                  | Example                                            | Rationale                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`               | Required by cabal.                                                                                                      | `plutus-core`                                      |                                                                                                                                         |
| `version`            | Required by cabal.                                                                                                      | `1.0.0`                                            |                                                                                                                                         |
| `cabal-version`      | Should be at least `3.4`.                                                                                               | `3.6`                                              | `3.4` is somewhat recent and removes some warts.                                                                                        |
| `build-type`         | Strongly prefer `Simple` and do not include `Setup.hs`. `Custom` can occasionally be necessary.                         | `Simple`                                           | All build types other than `Simple` have bad tooling support and are surprising to developers.                                          |
| `license`            | Must be `Apache-2.0`                                                                                                    | `Apache-2.0`                                       | See the [legal policy page](../../legal/index.html).                                                                                    |
| `license-file`       | Omit in favour of `license-files`.                                                                                      |                                                    | Apache 2.0 requires multiple license files.                                                                                             |
| `license-files`      | Must include both `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.                                                                               | `LICENSE NOTICE`                                   | See the [legal policy page](../../legal/index.html).                                                                                    |
| `copyright`          | Omit.                                                                                                                   |                                                    | See the [legal policy page](../../legal/index.html).                                                                                    |
| `author`             | Omit.                                                                                                                   |                                                    | Typically there is no clear single author of a package.                                                                                 |
| `maintainer`         | Optional, should be a person with significant responsibility according to the [project docs](../../project/index.html). | `john@iohk.io`                                     | We don't have more reliable and persistent maintainer email addresses than people's personal ones, so we have to use those if anything. |
| `stability`          | Omit.                                                                                                                   |                                                    | This is not usually meaningful for us, and is not widely used even in the Haskell OSS community.                                        |
| `homepage`           | Optional, if the project has a webpage, then use that, otherwise a github link usually works well.                      | `https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus`        |                                                                                                                                         |
| `bug-reports`        | Optional, should be the github issues link, or wherever community-reported issues are expected to go.                   | `https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/issues` | Github is usually our only public issue tracker.                                                                                        |
