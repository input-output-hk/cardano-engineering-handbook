- TODO: explain how to use the Creative Commons license

This section contains policies relating to legal matters.

## Licenses

Software MUST be licensed using the Apache 2.0 license.
Text-based work such as documentation SHOULD be licensed under a Creative Commons license.

## Applying the Apache 2.0 license to work

To apply the Apache 2.0 license to your work, two separate files need to be created in the root of the repository:

(1) a “NOTICE” file containing the following boilerplate notice:

```
Copyright 2022 Input Output Global, Inc. (IOG)

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License”). 
You may not use this file except in compliance with the License. 
You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
software distributed under the License is distributed on an 
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
either express or implied. See the License for the specific 
language governing permissions and limitations under the License.
```

(2) a “LICENSE” file containing the full license text which can be obtained from [here](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

### Rationale

Apache 2.0 is a permissive license that is widely deployed and backed by a strong community. 
Apache 2.0 allows users the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of it under the terms of the license, without any concern about royalties. 

A key advantage of the Apache 2.0 license is that it contains provisions that are absent from many other free and open source licenses (including the MIT license) and which provide more clarity to contributors and users alike. 

However, for text we can typically be much less restrictive.
For this a permissive license like Creative Commons is much more appropriate.

## Copyright assignment

Statements asserting copyright SHOULD NOT be made.

### Rationale

The provisions of the software license are more than adequate for the needs of the project.
We do not believe there are situations where it would be necessary to rely on copyright protections of the code.

Furthermore, this prevents us from needing burdensome CLAs to re-assign copyright from contributors.

## Disclaimers

Projects MAY use a Disclaimer like the one below.
This depends on the content of the project, and is usually only necessary if the project contains community contributions which are unvetted, or for which the maintainers are not willing to take responsibility for some other reason.

```
This site is for the benefit of the Cardano community and is owned and 
maintained by the community under an open source philosophy. 
Input Output Global, Inc. (IOG) is not responsible for, and makes no 
representations or warranties regarding, the accuracy, reliability and 
completeness of the aggregated content found in this repo. Any use of 
the open source Apache 2.0 licensed software is done at your own risk 
and on a “AS IS” basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind.
