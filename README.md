# The Cardano Engineeering Handbook

:construction::construction::construction::construction::construction::construction:

> In September 2022, right before the Vasil hard fork, Input Output Global held a workshop in Lisbon with the Core engineering team in order to reflect on the development process and identify concrete actions that could undertaken in order to improve this process and its outcome, namely the cardano-node.

This is the source repository the [Cardano Engineering Handbook](), a comprehensive resource about the development process of the Cardano core components that form the Cardano network.

The purpose of this handbook is to document the various practices that form the development lifecycle of software within the Cardano community.

# Building the book

The book can be built with the `mdbook` exectuable. 
If you use Nix, you can get a shell with `mdbook` using `nix develop`.
