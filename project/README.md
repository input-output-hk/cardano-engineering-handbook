# Project management

## Recommended documents

A project SHOULD contain the following documents:
- README
- CONTRIBUTING 
- SECURITY 
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- CHANGELOG (if the project includes multiple packages or similar, then one CHANGELOG per package may be appropriate)

The documents SHOULD be easily accessible and discoverable, ideally by being put in standard locations.

In the following policies, when we say that a document should "include information", this can either mean it includes it directly, or that it clearly links to where it can be found.

### CONTRIBUTING

A CONTRIBUTING document SHOULD include the following information:
- Roles and responsibilities for the project (TODO link)

### SECURITY

A SECURITY document MUST provide security@iohk.io as the contact email for security issues.

TODO: this should become a non-IOHK email address in due course.
