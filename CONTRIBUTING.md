# Contributing Guidelines

> How to contribute to this handbook?

> What's the process for accepting PRs?

* If you want to propose a new policy:
  * Do a PR changing the policy
  * Gather "rough" consensus -> Decider procedure
  * If it's accepted -> we should reach conformance into as many projects as possible
  * If it's rejected -> PR is closed
  * Exceptionally, the benevolent dictator of the repository can step in to accept a propsal when there is a wide majority for acceptance and a tiny minority for rejection -> eg. we don't want good proposals to be blocked by the whims or opinions of 1 person
* This process should take a reasonable amount of time
