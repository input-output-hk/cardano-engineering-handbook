## Communication channels

Should you have any questions or need some help in getting set up, you can use
these communication channels to reach the handbook team:

* GitHub tools, mainly [Issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-engineering-handbook/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-engineering-handbook/discussions)
* `#engineering` channel on IOG's slack

## Policies Acceptance Process

* If you want to propose a new policy:
  * Do a PR changing the policy
  * Gather "rough" consensus -> Decider procedure
  * If it's accepted -> we should reach conformance into as many projects as possible
  * If it's rejected -> PR is closed
  * Exceptionally, the benevolent dictator(s) of the repository can step in to accept a propsal when there is a wide majority for acceptance and a tiny minority for rejection -> eg. we don't want good proposals to be blocked by the whims or opinions of 1 person
* This process should take a reasonable amount of time

## Policies Content

Handbook policies are typically guidelines rather than prescriptions (although some might be prescriptive).
We expect each project under the umbrella of Cardano Open Source Consortium to use their judgement in applying policies, and there is no enforcement mechanism for most of them.

Policy recommendations SHOULD use [RFC2119-style](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) keywords.
This makes it obvious where recommendations are being made.
Since most policies are not prescriptive, most policies SHOULD primarily use SHOULD, with occasional use of MUST.

A policy SHOULD include the rationale for its guidelines.
This can be included near the guideline, or in its own section.
There are two reasons for including rationales:

1. People are more likely to follow policies if they understand what the point is, or what advantages they will be giving up by deviating from it,
2. The Handbook is a living document, and for people to engage with it and evolve it they need to be able to disagree with, update, or replace the underlying justifications.

A policy SHOULD be minimally prescriptive, unless specificity is needed to gain coordination benefits.
Generally, we want to let people use their judgement, and avoid putting people off by being pointlessly prescriptive.
However, in some circumstances we don't actually gain the benefit of the policy unless everyone follows it quite closely!
