# Introduction

This document forms the Cardano Engineering Handbook, which aims to provide documentation and policy that applies to all projects in the Cardano Open Source Project.

The goals of the Handbook are:
* Explicitly record "the way things are done" in order to minimize tribal knowledge
* Provide a place to record decisions on topics where coordination across the engineering organization is useful
* Encourage consistency across the organization in order to minimize cognitive overheads from unnecessary differences
* Be open to all contributors to the Cardano Open Source Project.

This is an aspirational project.
Much knowledge will not be recorded here; many topics we would like to coordinate on will be difficult to get consensus on; and consistency is not always welcome or desirable.
But it is important to have an open location to record this information when we do have it.

The target audience for this document is everyone working on a project owned by the Cardano Open Source Consortium.
To avoid confusion, we recommend that if a project is following this Handbook, then it should link back to it in the project README.
