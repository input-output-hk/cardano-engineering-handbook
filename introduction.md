Goal:
* Record a general consensus at some point in time
* Record decision for things which require coordination
* Converge towards a common way of doing things (?)
* It's fine for some stuff to be aspirational

Target audience:
* This is supposed to apply to all repositories owned by the Cardano Open Source Consortium
* Projects that are abiding by those guidelines should link back to this document to make it obvious for contributors
